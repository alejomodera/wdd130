            <p>Let's say that Bogota it's a little version of NYC. It is the largest city of Colombia, has a lot of buildings and it's very concurred of people from other countries. Most of our food and restaurants are made by people from other cultures that like to share their gastronomy with the city and the travelers. Of course we have a lot of restaurants that have the typical food of all Colombia and is extremely delicious.</p>
